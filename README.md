# IQ-Test

## **Introduction**

The Progressive Intelligence Test is a simple yet challenging program written in Python. The test consists of five questions, each with a set of multiple-choice answers. The questions are designed to measure different aspects of intelligence, such as logical reasoning, mathematical aptitude, and pattern recognition.

The test is structured so that each question increases in difficulty, providing a progressive challenge to the user. At the end of the test, the user's score is displayed along with an assessment of their performance.

## **Features**

- **Multiple Levels of Difficulty:** Questions increase in difficulty as the test progresses.
- **Variety of Question Types:** Includes mathematical sequences, logical puzzles, and pattern recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple text-based input system.
- **Scoring System:** Provides feedback on performance based on the user's score.

## **Questions Overview**

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:**
   - Tests mathematical sequence recognition.
   - Example: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ?

2. **Shape Series:**
   - Tests logical exclusion in patterns.
   - Example: Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle.

3. **Number Series:**
   - Tests arithmetic and geometric progression understanding.
   - Example: 6, 24, 60, 120, ?, 336.

4. **Rabbit Population Growth:**
   - Tests understanding of exponential growth in a scenario-based problem.
   - Example: Rabbits multiplying every 10 days.

5. **Clock Hands Overlap:**
   - Tests conceptual understanding of time and movement.
   - Example: How many times do the hour and minute hands of a clock overlap in a day?
